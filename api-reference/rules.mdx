title: Rules
---

For the safety and protection of our customer's (and your customer's information), we have to lay down some ground rules.

<div align='center'>
	
	## ⚠️ PLEASE READ CAREFULLY ⚠️

	<br/>

	1.) **No authentication of products that did not originate from you.**
	
	If you bought a luxury clothing item that didn't have an NFC authentication tag in it, you cannot act as a third-party guarantor of authenticity.

	<br/>

	2.) **No storing of personal information within a tag's metadata.**

	This does not include unique IDs that point to a user's information in a system outside of ETRNL.

	<br/>

	3.) **These tags should not be used to gain access to any highly sensitive information such as medical records, legal documents, or personal information**
