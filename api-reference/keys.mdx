title: API Keys
---

We have 2 different keys that can be used to authenticate with our API.
However, the private key has more access.

## Creating your keys
You can create your API keys by navigating to your organization's [API Settings](https://etrnl.app/settings/organization/api)
(you must be an administrator to access this page) and clicking on the "GENERATE KEYS" button.

Once your keys have been generate, the page should look something like below.

You can click on refresh icon on the right to deactivate the existing public/private key and generate a new one.
You can also click on the sliders on the left to enable/disable an API key.

## Private Key
The purpose of the private key is to perform CRUD operations on objects within an organization (ExternalURLGroups, Metadata Queue Items, etc.).
This key should never be used within frontend/client side code and should be stored somewhere secure.

## Public Key
<Warning>**It is strongly recommended that you perform authentication on the backend server and only use the private key.**</Warning>
The public key only has access to the /v1/verifyTag route.
If you want to build an MVP of a product quickly and don't want to setup your own server, you can authenticate a tag on your website
by using some fairly basic javascript.
