title: What is an NFC Tag?
---

An NFC Tag (also known as the PICC - Proximity Integrated Circuit Card) is a very tiny computer which is also connected to an antenna. The tag reader, also known as the PCD (Proximity Coupling Device), generates a pulsating electromagnetic field which provides power to the tag. Once the tag has power, it is able to communicate with the reader, and the reader with it.

NFC tags come in many shapes and forms.
There are NFC stickers, wristbands, cards, sewable clothing tags, plastic tags, metal, tags, and the list goes on! As long as the antenna is tuned properly, you can put NFC tags in nearly anything!
And with the rising popularity in contactless payments, itâ€™s predicted that over 1.1 billion smartphones will be shipped with NFC support by the end of 2022.
