## Creating a secured page
<Note>This step assumes that you've already created an account and organization. If not, please <a href='https://etrnl.app/register' target='_blank'>sign up</a>.</Note>
A secure page is what your customers will see when they want to authenticate their products.
You can use a secure page to display information about the product and provide access to exclusive information when the user is authenticated.

<br/>

To start, make sure you're logged into your account, and click on <b>PAGES -> CREATE</b> (or just click <a href='https://etrnl.app/pages/create' target='_blank'>here</a>).

</Frame>

<br/>

You will see a prompt where you can type the name of the secure page.
This will typically be the name of the product you're going to be authenticating.
Once you're done, click the <b>SUBMIT</b> button, or press enter.

## Customizing your page
<Note>
We currently offer limited customizability using our page builder, but we're actively working on a fully customizable version
using drag & drop components. Follow our <a target='_blank' href='https://discord.gg/FvNtx5ga8h'>Discord</a> for updates!
</Note>
You can modify the image, details, and security messages for your products here.
Click on the <b>Content</b> dropdown in the left sidebar and upload an image of your product.

Once you have an image uploaded, write a sentence or 2 about your product in the <b>Details</b> textbox.
Now just click the <b>SAVE</b> button in the bottom right and you're done!
