Secure pages not only support HTML/Markdown, but also supports <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank">handlebars</a>
syntax to inject dynamic variables and add custom logic.

## Dynamic variables
Dynamic variables can be used within your custom page to display additional data to your users.
They can also be used to add custom logic on your pages to show/hide content.

### Hiding content
Wrapping the variable within 2 opening & closing curly brackets will display the variable.

If you copy/paste the following code into the details section of your page, it will display the number of tags that have been programmed to that page.
```handlebars
<b>Tag count:</b> {{ page.totalTagCount }}
```

<Frame>
	<img src='/images/screenshots/tagCount-handlbars-example.png'/>
</Frame>
<Note>In the editor, it will show <b>XXX</b> as a placeholder for this variable, but tapping the tag will show the actual value</Note>

### Conditionally displaying content
Content can be displayed conditionally by using the variables within a handlebars if/else statements.
Let's say you wanted to show a video to the user if they own one of your products.

You details would look something like this:
```html
{{#if authentic}}

<iframe
	width="100%"
	height="315"
	src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QH2-TGUlwu4?si=p5Zuwpd_8ZqEtozO"
	title="YouTube video player"
	frameborder="0"
	allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
	allowfullscreen
/>

{{else}}

<p>:(</p>

{{/if}}
```
You can copy/paste the above code into your page's details and it would hide the video if the tag is inauthentic.
